        <h3>Intro to Day 02 Notes</h3>
        <ul class="notes">
            <li>Most code in this 30 Days of React will be in ES6</li>
            <li>ES5 was finalized in 2009</li>
            <li>ES6 was finalized in 2015 (but IE11 does not support it)</li>
            <li>JSX is a preprocessor step that adds XML syntax to JavaScript. You can use React without JSX, but it makes React a lot more elegant.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>In order to reap the benefits of ES6, we must - </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Transpile the code so that a wider range of browsers understand our JavaScript. This converts ES6 into ES5.</li>
            <li>Have to include a shim or polyfill that provides functionality added in ES6 that a browser may or may not have.</li>
        </ul>
